# Ghost Geometry Simplification Summary

## Overview
The ghost character geometry has been simplified from a complex multi-part system to a clean, efficient design consisting of:
- A semi-sphere (hemisphere) for the head
- A cylinder with wavy bottom edge for the body
- Simple tapered cylinders for arms

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CharacterBuilder (`/js/character-builder.js`)

**Replaced complex geometry creation with:**
- `createSimpleGhostGeometry()` - Main method that creates the simplified ghost
- `createWavyBottomCylinder()` - Custom geometry for the body with wavy bottom edge
- `createSimpleArm()` - Simple tapered cylinder arms

**Removed complex methods:**
- `createWisp()` - Complex ethereal extensions
- `createArm()` - Complex multi-segment arms  
- `createGhostTail()` - Multi-segment tail system

### 2. Updated Animation System (`/js/ghost-character.js`)

**Simplified animations:**
- Removed complex tail segment animations
- Added simple body wave animation to enhance the wavy bottom effect
- Kept essential floating and arm movement animations

### 3. Created Three.js Reference Implementation (`/js/simplified-ghost-threejs.js`)

**Complete Three.js implementation featuring:**
- `SimplifiedGhostThreeJS` class with clean geometry creation
- Custom `createWavyBottomCylinder()` method using BufferGeometry
- Animation methods for floating, body waves, and arm movements
- Usage examples and documentation

## Key Features of the New Geometry

### Semi-Sphere Head
```javascript
// Babylon.js version
const head = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("ghostHead", {
    diameter: 1.4,
    segments: 32,
    slice: Math.PI // Only upper half (hemisphere)
}, this.scene);

// Three.js version  
const headGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.7, 32, 16, 0, Math.PI * 2, 0, Math.PI / 2);
```

### Cylinder Body with Wavy Bottom
- Procedurally generated custom geometry
- Smooth cylinder that transitions to wavy bottom edge
- Uses sine waves to create organic ghost-like flowing effect
- Configurable wave amplitude and frequency

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced vertex count**: From hundreds of individual spheres/segments to single unified meshes
- **Fewer draw calls**: Consolidated geometry reduces rendering overhead  
- **Cleaner animations**: Simplified structure allows for more efficient animations
- **Better maintainability**: Clear, focused geometry creation methods

## Files Modified
- `/js/character-builder.js` - Updated with simplified geometry creation
- `/js/ghost-character.js` - Updated animation system for new geometry
- `/js/simplified-ghost-threejs.js` - New Three.js reference implementation (created)

## Implementation Details

### Wavy Bottom Algorithm
The wavy bottom effect is achieved by:
1. Creating vertical rings of vertices from top to bottom
2. For the bottom 30% of rings, applying sine wave displacement
3. Wave intensity increases toward the bottom for natural ghost-like flow
4. Proper normal calculation for smooth lighting

### Animation Integration
- Body wave animation enhances the static wavy geometry
- Floating animation affects the entire ghost group
- Simple arm rotations for ethereal movement
- Head tracking maintains viewer engagement

The simplified ghost maintains the ethereal, otherworldly appearance while being much more efficient to render and animate.
